My CS260 startup project and notes

Change from dev environment

Change from GitHub

Change from VS Code

When I got to the merge issues part of the assignment, I couldn't figure out how to get the two versions to merge until I used VS Code. I think this was useful for me to figure out what way is easiest for me to find solutions to common problems. I am excited to keep using GitHub since it is really fascinating to me how the branches can communicate with each other. I will try to commit often so I can keep good track of my work in GitHub
