My CS260 startup project and notes

Change from dev environment

Change from GitHub

Change from VS Code

When I got to the merge issues part of the assignment, I couldn't figure out how to get the two versions to merge until I used VS Code. I think this was useful for me to figure out what way is easiest for me to find solutions to common problems. I am excited to keep using GitHub since it is really fascinating to me how the branches can communicate with each other. I will try to commit often so I can keep good track of my work in GitHub

In HTML don't forget your closing tags! Also, W3Schools has really good info for using HTML, so if you get stuck, try visiting their website.

###### Mad Match Notes -
- I learned that for some reason even though I am using two different css sheets, my program couldn't recognize the difference between them, which is why all of the items in login.css are referred to by id names instead of element names
- Learned that the best resource for learning bootstrap is either bootstrap website or stack overflow
- Testing using the web debugger can help determine if viewer will work on different devices
- Don't get frustrated! Sometimes it's just an easy fix! Comment out a line and test to see if it changes anything
- If it's not working, try wrapping it in another div ;)
- Class and Id's can be really important for distinguishing items! Use them and use names that make sense!
